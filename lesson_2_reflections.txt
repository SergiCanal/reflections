Viewing a diff working has showed me how simple it is 
to look for differences between different files.

If I can reach easily the different versions of a file, I will be 
faster when I need to look for some mistake I have done.

Manual saving vs Automatic saving: manual gives us more freedom because we can choose when to commit,
but in front of that, we must remember to commit every time we finish a little work, and that is not done sometimes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google docs is focused to documents which don't need other files coexisting. The ones in Git they do.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the different commits made in the different files, with their IDs
git diff lets us know the differences between 2 files, so that we can see the changes done in that commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Always I break anything I can go back to the previous version and check what I did wrong
