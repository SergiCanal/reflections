What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
There aren't any commits and we can see a .git file if we do ls -a.
We can see the files in the repository as untracked files.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Use it to work in Heypey app.
